# ü¶úüï∏Ô∏è Awesome LangGraph ![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)

LangGraph is a framework for building stateful multi-actor applications, modeling steps as graph nodes and edges. It offers interfaces for agent creation and custom flow composition.

> Inspired by [awesome-langchain](https://github.com/kyrolabs/awesome-langchain) (7.8k+ ‚≠ê), this is a curated list of tools and projects using Langchain.

## LangChain Ecosystem

LangChain simplifies LLM application development with:

- **langchain-core**: Core abstractions
- **langchain**: Chains and agents
- **Integration Packages**: Specific integrations
- **langchain-community**: Third-party integrations

## LangSmith

LangSmith enhances LangGraph with tools for debugging, testing, and monitoring, offering commercial solutions for optimization.

## LangGraph Platform

LangGraph Platform is a commercial solution for deploying agentic applications to production, built on the open-source LangGraph framework.

The LangGraph Platform consists of several components that support development, deployment, debugging, and monitoring:

- **[LangGraph Server](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_platform/#overview)**: Defines an opinionated API and architecture for deploying agentic applications.
- **LangGraph Studio**: A specialized IDE for visualization, interaction, and debugging.
- **LangGraph CLI**: A command-line interface for interacting with a local LangGraph.
- **Python/JS SDK**: Provides a programmatic way to interact with deployed LangGraph applications.
- **Remote Graph**: Allows interaction with deployed LangGraph applications as if they were running locally.
