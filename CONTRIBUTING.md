## How to Contribute

### Fork the repository

### Create a new branch
Create a new branch for your changes. This keeps your changes separate from the main project until they're ready to be merged. A good branch name describes the changes you're making, e.g., `add-new-project`, `fix-typo`, or `update-category`.

```bash
git checkout -b add-new-project
```

### Make your changes
Edit the `README.md` file following the existing format.

#### Adding a new project:
```markdown
| [username/project-name](https://github.com/username/project-name) | Brief description with key features | ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/username/project-name?style=social) |
```

**Requirements:**
- Use correct category and maintain alphabetical order
- Clear description (under 200 chars)
- Verify the project uses LangChain/LangGraph

### Commit your changes
Commit your changes with a clear and concise message explaining what you've done.

```bash
git commit -m "Add new XYZ project to Data Science category"
```

### Push your branch
Push your branch to your forked repository.

```bash
git push origin add-new-project
```

### Create a pull request
Go to the original repository and click the "New pull request" button. Select your forked repository and branch. Provide a clear title and description of your changes in the pull request.
